# Steam-OpenID--MyBB-
A proof of concept plugin for MyBB. This plugin allows users to login and post using their Steam account via Steam API. 

Version 2
- - -
This version is a new focus for the project, mainly building around the core login/register of the MyBB software.
Please note that this version is still in development and is recommended **not to be run on a live installation**.

You can help out by downloading this version and testing it out on a development installation. We recommend running a clean installation as an upgrade has not yet been coded.

The plugin supports both; MyBB 1.6 & MyBB 1.8
